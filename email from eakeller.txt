> Here are the notes that I have from our meeting today:
> 
> Having a tutorial round for a complex strategy game like this would be a
> great idea to impliment. You also may want to chose a better color for the
> green player that will stand out more from the background. You can play
> around with the other colors if you need to to support this.
> 
> Please forward this to the rest of your teammates.
