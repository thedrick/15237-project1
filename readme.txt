Based off of Final Fantasy Tactics (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feP9LG_VgHc#t=1m53s), Archer's Revenge is a turn based strategy RPG. Features that we'd like to add to improve the game further include choice of where to place units and a bottom screen menu bar instead of the floating corner menus.


To play: 
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor.
Click enter to select a unit and its actions.
Hit ESC to deselect a unit or cancel an action.
You and your opponent will take turns moving your respective units. Each unit may move once and attack once per turn. If your unit does not both move and attack on it's turn, you must have the unit wait and choose a direction to wait in. Once all of your units have acted, your turn will end and your opponent's turn will begin. Be the first player to destroy your opponent's units to win!



Skills: 

Javascript in html file and in its own file. 
Global and local scope as necessary. Type conversion between int and string when drawing damage & etc on the screen. Boolean operations, switch statements, if statements, for loops, ternery operator throughout. 

Functions (including as functions as values) in the units code. Arrays in the movement and magic code for drawing. Foreach iterations, math methods, array slicing.

Objects (primarily with constructors) for units.

Canvas, rectangles, strokes, fills, text, alpha values, circles, keyboard and timer events. Thorough images and sprites. 

All of the above are used throughout and extensively in our code.
